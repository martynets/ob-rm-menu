The ob-rm-menu is Openbox pipe menu removable medias manager. It shows
currently present removable medias and their partitions with mount/unmount
actions presented as submenus.

By default the script uses udevil for mount/unmount operations to avoid *kits
dependent packages. But this is customizable and can be replaced with a tool
of choice.

This project is on early development stage and has a lot of items in TODO list.
Current version presents basic functionality but the author believes it can
serve for most cases.

Software Requirements
---------------------

The ob-rm-menu script depends on the following software packages:
- the bash version 4.0+
- kernel 2.6+ (sysfs mounted at /sys)
- udev (udevadm tool)
- udevil (mount/unmount operations - customizable)
- eject (eject CDs operations - customizable)
- coreutils (sync tool - customizable)
- xdg-bash-functions package (https://github.com/martynets/xdg-bash-functions)

The last one package must be manually installed from the repository somewhere in
your PATH. Please see its README file for additional information.

Installation
------------

This script is the Openbox pipe menu and needs to be installed as per the
Openbox requirements. It can be copied to any convenient location and reference
to it must be added to Openbox menu file which name and location default to
$HOME/.config/openbox/menu.xml. Something similar to the following must be
added:

    <menu id="ob-rm-menu" label="Removable Medias"
        execute="/path/to/script/ob-rm-menu"
            icon="/path/to/icontheme/devices/16/media-removable.svg"/>

More information on Openbox menu configuration can be found on its wiki page:

  http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Menus

Configuration
-------------

The ob-rm-menu script can be configured via configuration file named
ob-rm-menu.conf. It is searched in directories listed in the
XDG_CONFIG_DIRS variable first for system wide settings. Next it is searched
in the path from XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable and is considered as the
user specific settings. The latter overrides settings of the former.

The files are sourced by the script and thus must conform to the bash shell
syntax.

The files consist mostly of the xdg-bash-functions' (icon-functions)
customizable variables and define some XDG defaults and preferences. For
more information see comments inside the sample configuration file and
appropriate freedesktop.org specifications.

There are some settings (variables) there specific to the script. They are
self describing and commented in the samle configuration file. As the script
is being developed the customizable variables are subject to change and will
be documented with released version.
